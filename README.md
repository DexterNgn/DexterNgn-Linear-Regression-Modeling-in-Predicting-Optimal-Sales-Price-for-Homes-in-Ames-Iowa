# Data-Driven Pricing Model for Homes in Ames, Iowa
This is a part of my team project in the Applied Statistics and Probability course at Duke University, Business Analytics Program

### 1. Business Goal
With the dynamic state of the housing market, we seek to create a data-driven model for pricing homes in the Ames, Iowa market. In doing so, we will draw insights into the variables that drive sale price (our target variable) of a given home in the market of interest. Furthermore, our hope is that this model may be easily extrapolated to comparable housing markets—a theory which we will back-test with similar available housing datasets. We intend to leverage a supervised learning technique to create a regression with a continuous target variable.

### 2. Use Case (and Busines Value)
Having a greater understanding of the variables that drive sale price will allow brokers and agencies to price homes based on a concrete model and an understanding of the variables that most impact sale price. Data-driven pricing, in theory, will result in lower resource use on the part of the
agents, and thus, a quicker (and more lucrative) sale.

### 3. Data Sourcing
Our analysis will focus on the Ames, Iowa Housing Dataset compiled by Dean De Cock in 2011. This dataset includes 79 explanatory variables related to homes in the Ames market,
including lot size, road access, zoning classification, and land contour. As mentioned above, we believe our target variable (price) to be more-or-less dependent on these variables—our goal being to determine the variables with the strongest correlation.
